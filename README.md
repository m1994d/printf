# holbertonschool-printf

Write your own printf function.

The _printf program is a pseudo- recreation of the C standard library function, printf as part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School Colombia.


In this activity, we tried to create functions to produce the output accord the specified format.

We had to create a repository in GitHub called Printf and in this put all the archives related to the project. This was made in group.
